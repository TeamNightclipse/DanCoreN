# DanCoreN

A rewrite of the core parts of DanmakuCore in Rust. Is this related to the Java version of DanCore? Maybe, it might
serve as the core of the Java version, or it might become its own thing. I have no idea at this point, and sadly it
will probably be a long time until either of those possibilities become reality.

For now, this is its own thing. A proof of concept of a fast Danmaku engine written in Rust. Nothign more, nothing
less.
